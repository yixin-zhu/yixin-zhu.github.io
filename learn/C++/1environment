# Environment and Basics

## VM, SSH
We use VMware Workstation to run our Ubuntu.

And ssh to it to practice working without Graphical User Interface.

## GCC
### install and check
```cpp
sudo apt install gcc g++
g++ --version
```


### basic use
```cpp
gcc test.c -o app
./app

gcc test.c -E -o test.i
gcc test.i -S -o test.s
gcc test.s -s -o test.o
gcc test.c -o2
gcc test.c -D DEBUG
```
the last one should be used with
```cpp
#ifdef DEBUG
// something
#endif

```

### gcc and g++
- gcc and g++ can both be used for c and c++ program. However, g++ can't link with c++'s library automatically. must use 'gcc -lstdc++'

## Library
Library is also a kind of program, but can't be used alone.

Static libraries are copied at link time, dynamic libraries are loaded at runtime.

### Static libraries
libxxx.a(Linux), libxxx.lib(Windows)
```cpp
gcc -c xxx.c
ar rcs libxxx.a xxx.o xxx.o

// use example
gcc main.c -o app -I ./include/ -l xxx -L
```

### dynamic libraries
